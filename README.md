# Design_RAG_for_LLM
# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for Medical Applications

This repository demonstrates how to implement a **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using a medical dataset. The RAG system combines the power of a vector database for retrieving relevant information and a Large Language Model (LLM) for generating contextual responses.

---

## Features
- Create embeddings from a medical dataset using `SentenceTransformers`.
- Store and manage embeddings in a vector database using `Qdrant`.
- Retrieve relevant context based on a query using cosine similarity.
- Use a local or cloud-based LLM to generate a grounded, accurate response.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following:
1. Python 3.8 or higher installed.
2. The following Python libraries:
   - `sentence-transformers`
   - `qdrant-client`
   - `transformers`
   - `pandas`

Install them using pip:
```bash
pip install sentence-transformers qdrant-client transformers pandas

## Usage

### Step 1: Prepare Your Medical Dataset
Ensure your dataset is in a CSV format with at least two columns:

- `title`: Title of the medical document or topic.
- `content`: Detailed content about the topic.

**Example CSV (`medical_knowledge.csv`):**

| title        | content                                      |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Diabetes     | Diabetes symptoms include thirst, ...       |
| Hypertension | Hypertension leads to high blood ...        |

---

### Step 2: Code Implementation
Execute rag_medical.py file.

```bash
python rag_medical.py

## How It Works

1. **Embed the Dataset**: Use `SentenceTransformers` to generate vector embeddings of the medical dataset (`content`).
2. **Store in Qdrant**: Save embeddings in a vector database (`Qdrant`) for fast similarity-based retrieval.
3. **Retrieve Context**: Query the vector database to fetch the most relevant medical content based on user input.
4. **Generate Response**: Pass the retrieved context to an LLM (e.g., GPT-2) to generate an informed, grounded response.

---

## Customization

1. **Use Another Vector Database**:
   - Replace Qdrant with alternatives like `FAISS` or `Pinecone`.

2. **Use Another LLM**:
   - Replace GPT-2 with any Hugging Face model or use APIs like OpenAI's GPT-4.

3. **Add More Data**:
   - Expand the knowledge base with additional medical documents to improve response quality.

## Example Output

### Query:

What are the symptoms of diabetes?


### Retrieved Context:

Diabetes symptoms include thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and blurred vision.


### LLM Response:

The symptoms of diabetes include increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and blurred vision. Itâ€™s recommended to consult a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.
